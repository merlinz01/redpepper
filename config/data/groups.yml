# This file defines the groups to which each agent belongs.
# The groups are used to define the requests, state definitions, and data that each agent has access to.
# If you want an agent to have exclusive access to something, define a group with the agent's name and add the agent to that group.

# Each entry consist of either the name of an agent or a simple glob pattern to match multiple agents.
# The value is an array of group names that the agent belongs to.
# Group names must bed alphanumeric and can contain hyphens and underscores: re.match(r"^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$", group_name)
