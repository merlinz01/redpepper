# Operations

An _operation_ is a procedure that can be performed on an agent's machine in order to produce a certain outcome.

Operations are analogous to [Salt](https://github.com/saltstack/salt) commands.

[States](states.md) are multiple operations which ensure an agent's machine is in a desired state.

## Defining operations

Operations are defined as subclasses of `redpepper.operations.Operation`.
These classes are stored in Python files as submodules of `redpepper.operations`.

You can define your own custom operation modules as Python files in the `operations` directory of the manager's agent-data directory.
These are automatically transmitted to and stored on agents' machines.

> All agents can access all operation modules, so don't put any secrets in your custom modules unless you are OK with all agents being able to access them.

> Because of the ability to define custom operations,
> the RedPepper project intends to limit the "built-in" operations
> to basic system administration utilities,
> rather than providing support for every operation under the sun,
> at least in this Git repository.
> If you define a specialized operation that you think could be useful to others,
> feel free to publish it in your own Github repository.

An operation can define the following methods:

### `def __init__(self, ...)`

An operation's `__init__` method defines the parameters a command takes.
Parameter validation and assigning parameters to attributes should be done here.

If an error is raised in the `__init__` method, it will stop all further operations and be reported to the user.

### `async def __str__(self) -> str`

Operations should define this method to provide
a concise, user-friendly indicator of the operation and its parameters.
It should indicate the module and name of the operation
along with the important parameters.
This does not need to be a valid Python expression.

Example format: `file.Installed("/some/file" from "some-source-file.txt")`

### `async def run(self, agent: Agent) -> Result`

This method is generally where the operation is executed.

This method is called by the default implementation of the `ensure()` method
when the `test()` method returns False.

The first thing to do in this method is to set up a Result object to store information about the operation's execution.

```python
result = Result()
```

If you need to run an external program frome this method,
do it like this:

```python
import subprocess
...
p = subprocess.run(
    ['/usr/bin/some-command', '--argument'],
    capture_output=True,
    text=True,
)
if not result.check_completed_process(p).succeeded:
    return result
```

This will update the result with the output of the command,
and set the success attribute to False.

If you know an operation might raise a Python error,
you can just not handle the error and it will be reported to the user.
However, sometimes we have some information (like previous process outputs)
that would be useful to report to the user along with the error traceback.
If that is the case, handle it like this:

```python
# Beforehand, result contains some useful information that we want the user to see whether or not the error occurrs.
try:
    # Some operation that "might" raise an error
    1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # This retrieves exception information from sys.exc_info(),
    # adds the traceback to the output, and marks the result as failed.
    result.exception()
    return result
```

If you need to access [data](data.md) defined for the agent,
use the provided agent's `request_data()` method.

```python
ok, data = agent.request_data('some.key.defined.in.the.YAML.files')
```

### `async def test(self, agent: Agent) -> bool`

This function is to determine if the operation needs to be executed,
or whether the desired outcome already exists.

Return True if the outcome already exists, or False if it does not and the command needs to be run.

By default this function returns False,
so that the operation's `run()` method is called every time.

### `async def ensure(self, agent: Agent) -> Result`

Make sure the outcome exists by executing the operation if needed.
This is the method is called by RedPepper when a command or state is executed.

The default implementation is basically a combination of `test()` and `run()`.
Many operations will not need to reimplement this method,
as this default implementation is sufficient.
However, in some cases it may be better to skip an explicit test and simply execute the command every time, checking the output of the command to determine if anything changed.

## Example

```python
import os
from redpepper.operations import Operation, Result

class WriteSomeConfigFile(Operation):
    def __init__(self, host, port, username, password, filename='/etc/some/file.conf'):
        # Validate and save parameters
        self.host = host
        self.port = int(port)
        if not isalnum(username):
            raise ValueError('username must be alphanumeric')
        self.username = username
        self.password = password
        self.filename = filename

    def __str__(self):
        # Return a concise representation of the operation
        return f'custom.WriteSomeConfigFile({self.username}:***@{self.host}:{self.port} to file {self.filename})'

    async def test(self, agent):
        # Test if the file already exists
        return os.path.isfile(self.filename)

    async def run(self, agent):
        # Write the file
        result = Result()
        with open(self.filename, 'w') as out:
            out.write(f'Host = {self.host}\n')
            out.write(f'Port = {self.port}\n')
            out.write(f'Username = {self.username}\n')
            out.write(f'Password = "{self.password}"\n')
        result.changed = True
        result += f'Wrote config file to {self.filename}'
        return result
```
